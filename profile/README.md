Google Developer Student Clubs Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University College of Engineering Pune is a Google Developers program for university students to learn skills in the domains of mobile development, web development, machine learning, and cloud (primarily). We also help encourage different other domains like competetive programming, ethical hacking, AR/VR, etc. The club is open to any student, ranging from novice developers who are just starting, to advanced developers who want to further their skills. The club is intended as a space for students to try out new ideas and collaborate to solve mobile and web development problems.
